## Assignment
1) like about Github:
Something that I like about GitHub is the ability to have branches. I often will go off and tinker with code for better or sometimes not fully needed features and sometimes they just don't work so the ability to have that code in a separate location/path from the main  until it is a fully fledged feature is very beneficial to both myself and any team I am working with

2) dislike about GitHub
I am not a fan of the UI. I feel like there are some features of using git that could easily be hidden and some that should just be there. But this is just a bit of a nitpick. Otherwise I don't love the idea of 1 mistake with private information could result in major major problems due to how repositories work and being on various machines.

3) At least one question
I guess a followup on one of my dislikes, what types of privacy options are there on GitHub? I am able to access the assignment repository, but is just anyone able to? Is posting to GitHub the making public part and anything that should be private is on the local?

Bonus) The hidden message is:
Extra credit for using Git throughout the course!
